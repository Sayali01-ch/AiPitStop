# AiPitStop Frontend

Vite + React frontend that calls the backend API.

Development
- npm install --legacy-peer-deps
- npm run dev

Build
- npm run build

The dev server proxies requests to the backend when run locally via `/api`.

This scaffold now includes Tailwind CSS for styles, prompt history, loading states, image preview, and improved accessibility.
